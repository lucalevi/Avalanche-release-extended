# Avalanche Release Area Identification Model

## Overview

This R script implements an algorithm for automated identification of potential avalanche release areas. It extends the original work by Jochen Veitinger and Betty Sovilla, incorporating additional parameters to enhance avalanche hazard assessment.

## What's New

The extended model (PRA_new.R) builds upon the original algorithm (PRA_R.r) by including:

- Snowpack stability analysis
- Dangerous aspects and altitudes
- Snow cover mask with aspect-varying boundaries
- Calculation of dangerous steep slopes in a given area

These additions aim to provide more comprehensive and accurate avalanche hazard assessments.

## How It Works

The algorithm produces a raster map (ASCII format) with values ranging from 0 to 1:
- 0: Locations that are not Potential Release Areas (PRAs)
- 1: Locations that are totally PRAs

This output assists avalanche practitioners in their forecasting activities by visualizing and quantifying dangerous areas without human bias.

## Usage

### Input Parameters

```R
inputRas = "nameofDTM.asc"    # Input Digital Terrain Model
outPRA = "nameofoutputPRA.asc"    # Output file name
HS = 2.3     # Snow depth in meters
smooth = "Regular"    # Smoothing type: "Regular" or "Smooth"
wind = 180    # Wind direction (N=0, W=90, S=180)
windTol = 30    # Wind tolerance
work_dir = "H:/mydocuments"    # Working directory for intermediate results
```

### Required Libraries

The script uses several R libraries. Ensure these are installed:

```R
library(sp)
library(gstat)
library(shapefiles)
library(foreign)
library(methods)
library(plyr)
library(raster)
library(RSAGA)
```

### Main Processing Steps

1. Preliminary calculations and data preparation
2. Computation of wind shelter index
3. Calculation of ruggedness at different scales
4. Correction of snow surface roughness with slope
5. Definition of membership functions for roughness, slope, and wind shelter
6. Application of fuzzy logic operator to combine factors

### Output

The script generates a raster file (specified by `outPRA`) representing the potential release areas.

## Forest Module (Optional)

There's an optional forest module. To use a forest mask (ASCII file where forest = 1, no forest = 0), uncomment the respective lines at the end of the script.
