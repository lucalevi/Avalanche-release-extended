# What is it?

Avalanche bulletins use graphics, text and icons in order to inform about avalanche hazard, but detailed geographical evidence localisying dangerous areas lacks. 

Attempting to overcome this limitation, a numerical model was developed to support avalanche forecasters: it automatically visualises and quantifies dangerous areas free of human bias, by calculating the release propensity of slab avalanches according to current snow and weather conditions. 

## Why two R files?
The model PRA_new.R extends the existing algorithm PRA_R.r.
Original code at https://github.com/jocha81/Avalanche-release 

The parameters of the extended model were determined analysing avalanche bulletins and with a professioanl survey. Several parameters have been integrated: snowpack stability, dangerous aspects and altitudes, and a snow cover mask with aspect-varying boundaries. The model calculates finally the amount of dangerous steep slopes in a given area. 

Citing from the original readme, "The algorithm produces a raster map (asci format) which values ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates locations where avalanches are not possible to release whereas a value of 1 corresponds to locations that are highly favourable for avalanche release."

Both the original and the extended tool help avalanche practictioners in their forecasting activity.
